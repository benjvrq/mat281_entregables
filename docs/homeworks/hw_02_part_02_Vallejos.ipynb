Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n","\n","While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n","\n","In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n","\n","> #### Recommended Tutorial\n",">\n","> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n","\n","###  Overview of How Kaggle‚Äôs Competitions Work\n","\n","1.  **Join the Competition**  \n","    Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n","2.  **Get to Work**  \n","    Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n","3.  **Make a Submission**  \n","    Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n","4.  **Check the Leaderboard**  \n","    See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.\n","5.  **Improve Your Score**  \n","    Check out the [discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion) to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n","\n","> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n",">\n","> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks.

It‚Äôs your job to predict these outcomes.\n","\n","Using the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n","\n","Check out the [‚ÄúData‚Äù tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you‚Äôve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n","\n","###  How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\n","\n","Once you‚Äôre ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n","\n","1.
